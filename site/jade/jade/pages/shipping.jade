            p Please note that Janestyle store only ships purchases to the billing address which is registered under your credit card on file. We understand that receiving orders delivered at your home address may not always be convenient and that you may prefer to receive boxes to an office or at any another location. To accommodate this, we suggest asking your bank about adding an additional address to the existing billing address that is registered to card on file. Once done, youâ€™ll be able to use such an alternate shipping destination as well.
