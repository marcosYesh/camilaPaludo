          p.txt-darker What's the thinking behind creativity at Janestyle?
          p The creative thinking behind our works aims to show the real beauty, combined with elegancy and simplicity.
          p.txt-darker.offset-top-33 What sets Janestyle apart?
          p I am sure that we understand women are shopping always and they do that specifically to underline their individuality and uniqueness. Also, I strongly believe that the stylish, great designs can and should be easily combined together with the main functionality. Exactly that's why construction and fit of the clothes is such an important point. We do and sell only those clothes and outfit, that can make you look as outstanding and good as possible. Also that is the reason we do not stick to seasonal trends - we believe that constant diversity is the key.
          p.txt-darker.offset-top-33 Describe the label's signature aesthetics...
          p It's about being capable of wearing some chunky brogues together with a lace dress...That may make people turn around again and think, 'oh, that actually works and looks good'
          p.txt-darker.offset-top-33 What's the key to making the cut in the fashion world?
          p Something I’ve been a great believer in for a long time is that not having passion for what person's doing will always prevent him from doing his best job. You need to give fashion everything you have. Legendary Coco Chanel's quote is the one I like to give as an example of that philosophy: ‘Fashion is not simply a matter of clothes. Fashion is in the air, born upon the wind. One intuits it. It is in the sky and on the road.' So being an observer who can take and mix a little of everything from everyone is what I think is an important thing.
          p.txt-darker.offset-top-33 How has the team's style influenced the collections?
          p One of our very first dresses made was actually based on it's design of one of the old ones up in your drawers. The main idea out of such a situation is to project each team member's personality onto everything fashion related we do here, at Janestyle.
